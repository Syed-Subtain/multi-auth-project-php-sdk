## Usage Example

### Client Initialization

You must provide credentials in the client as shown in the following code snippet.

```php
$client = MultiAuthSampleClientBuilder::init()
    ->apiHeaderCredentials(
        ApiHeaderCredentialsBuilder::init(
            'token',
            'api-key'
        )
    )
    ->build();
```
